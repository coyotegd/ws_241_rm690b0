1. General description
                            The PCF85063A is a CMOS1 Real-Time Clock (RTC) and calendar optimized for low
                            power consumption. An offset register allows fine-tuning of the clock. All addresses and
                            data are transferred serially via the two-line bidirectional I2C-bus. Maximum data rate is
                            400 kbit/s. The register address is incremented automatically after each written or read
                            data byte.

[1]    The die paddle (exposed pad) is connected to VSS through high ohmic (non-conductive) silicon attach and should be electrically
       isolated. It is good engineering practice to solder the exposed pad to an electrically isolated PCB copper pad as shown in Figure 37
       “Footprint information for reflow soldering of SOT1197-1 (DFN2626-10) of PCF85063ATL” for better heat transfer but it is not required
       as the RTC doesn’t consume much power. In no case should traces be run under the package exposed pad.

8. Functional description
                     The PCF85063A contains 18 8-bit registers with an auto-incrementing register address,
                     an on-chip 32.768 kHz oscillator with integrated capacitors, a frequency divider which
                     provides the source clock for the Real-Time Clock (RTC) and calender, and an I2C-bus
                     interface with a maximum data rate of 400 kbit/s.

                     The built-in address register will increment automatically after each read or write of a data
                     byte up to the register 11h. After register 11h, the auto-incrementing will wrap around to
                     address 00h (see Figure 5).

                      Fig 5.   Handling address registers

                     All registers (see Table 5) are designed as addressable 8-bit parallel registers although
                     not all bits are implemented. The first two registers (memory address 00h and 01h) are
                     used as control and status register. The register at address 02h is an offset register
                     allowing the fine-tuning of the clock; and at 03h is a free RAM byte. The addresses 04h
                     through 0Ah are used as counters for the clock function (seconds up to years counters).
                     Address locations 0Bh through 0Fh contain alarm registers which define the conditions for
                     an alarm. The registers at 10h and 11h are for the timer function.

                     The Seconds, Minutes, Hours, Days, Months, and Years as well as the corresponding
                     alarm registers are all coded in Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) format. When one of the
                     RTC registers is written or read, the contents of all time counters are frozen. Therefore,
                     faulty writing or reading of the clock and calendar during a carry condition is prevented.
                     For details on maximum access time, see Section 8.4 on page 25.

              8.2.1.1   EXT_TEST: external clock test mode
                        A test mode is available which allows for on-board testing. In this mode, it is possible to
                        set up test conditions and control the operation of the RTC.

                        The test mode is entered by setting bit EXT_TEST in register Control_1. Then
                        pin CLKOUT becomes an input. The test mode replaces the internal clock signal with the
                        signal applied to pin CLKOUT.

                        The signal applied to pin CLKOUT should have a minimum pulse width of 300 ns and a
                        maximum period of 1000 ns. The internal clock, now sourced from CLKOUT, is divided
                        down to 1 Hz by a 26 divide chain called a prescaler. The prescaler can be set into a
                        known state by using bit STOP. When bit STOP is set, the prescaler is reset to 0. (STOP
                        must be cleared before the prescaler can operate again.)

                        From a stop condition, the first 1 second increment will take place after 32 positive edges
                        on pin CLKOUT. Thereafter, every 64 positive edges cause a 1 second increment.

                        Remark: Entry into test mode is not synchronized to the internal 64 Hz clock. When
                        entering the test mode, no assumption as to the state of the prescaler can be made.

                        Operation example:

                         1. Set EXT_TEST test mode (register Control_1, bit EXT_TEST = 1).
                         2. Set STOP (register Control_1, bit STOP = 1).
                         3. Clear STOP (register Control_1, bit STOP = 0).
                         4. Set time registers to desired value.
                         5. Apply 32 clock pulses to pin CLKOUT.
                         6. Read time registers to see the first change.
                         7. Apply 64 clock pulses to pin CLKOUT.
                         8. Read time registers to see the second change.

                        Repeat 7 and 8 for additional increments.

               8.2.1.2   STOP: STOP bit function
                         The function of the STOP bit (see Figure 6) is to allow for accurate starting of the time
                         circuits. The STOP bit function causes the upper part of the prescaler (F2 to F14) to be
                         held in reset and thus no 1 Hz ticks are generated. It also stops the output of clock
                         frequencies below 8 kHz on pin CLKOUT.

                             The lower two stages of the prescaler (F0 and F1) are not reset. And because the I2C-bus
                             is asynchronous to the crystal oscillator, the accuracy of restarting the time circuits is
                             between zero and one 8.192 kHz cycle (see Figure 7).

              8.2.2.2   MI and HMI: minute and half minute interrupt
                        The minute interrupt (bit MI) and half minute interrupt (bit HMI) are pre-defined timers for
                        generating interrupt pulses on pin INT; see Figure 10. The timers are running in sync with
                        the seconds counter (see Table 19 on page 21).

                        The minute and half minute interrupts must only be used when the frequency offset is set
                        to normal mode (MODE = 0), see Section 8.2.3. In normal mode, the interrupt pulses on
                        pin INT are 1⁄64 s wide.

                        When starting MI, the first interrupt will be generated after 1 second to 59 seconds. When
                        starting HMI, the first interrupt will be generated after 1 second to 29 seconds.
                        Subsequent periods do not have such a delay. The timers can be enabled independently
                        from one another. However, a minute interrupt enabled on top of a half minute interrupt is
                        not distinguishable.

                        The duration of the timer is affected by the register Offset (see Section 8.2.3). Only when
                        OFFSET[6:0] has the value 00h the periods are consistent.

              8.2.2.3   TF: timer flag
                        The timer flag (bit TF) is set logic 1 on the first trigger of MI, HMI, or the countdown timer.
                        The purpose of the flag is to allow the controlling system to interrogate what caused the
                        interrupt: timer or alarm. The flag can be read and cleared by command.

                        The status of the timer flag TF can affect the INT pulse generation depending on the
                        setting of TI_TP (see Section 8.6.2 “Register Timer_mode” on page 30):

                         • When TI_TP is set logic 1
                            – an INT pulse is generated independent of the status of the timer flag TF
                            – TF stays set until it is cleared
                            – TF does not affect INT

                              – TF stays set until it is cleared
                              – If TF is not cleared before the next coming interrupt, no INT is generated

              8.2.2.4   COF[2:0]: Clock output frequency
                        A programmable square wave is available at pin CLKOUT. Operation is controlled by the
                        COF[2:0] bits in the register Control_2. Frequencies of 32.768 kHz (default) down to 1 Hz
                        can be generated for use as a system clock, microcontroller clock, input to a charge
                        pump, or for calibration of the oscillator.

                        Pin CLKOUT is a push-pull output and enabled at power-on. CLKOUT can be disabled by
                        setting COF[2:0] to 111 or by setting CLKOE LOW (PCF85063ATL only). When disabled,
                        the CLKOUT is LOW. If CLKOE is HIGH and COF[2:0]=111 there will be no clock and
                        CLKOUT will be LOW.

                        The duty cycle of the selected clock is not controlled. However, due to the nature of the
                        clock generation, all clock frequencies except 32.768 kHz have a duty cycle of 50 : 50.

                        The STOP bit function can also affect the CLKOUT signal, depending on the selected
                        frequency. When the STOP bit is set logic 1, the CLKOUT pin generates a continuous
                        LOW for those frequencies that can be stopped. For more details of the STOP bit function,
                        see Section 8.2.1.2.

                              40:60 depending on the detector since the 32,768 Hz is derived from the oscillator output which is not
                              perfect. It could change from device to device and it depends on the silicon diffusion. There is nothing that
                              can be done from outside the chip to influence the duty cycle.

                8.2.3 Register Offset
                      The PCF85063A incorporates an offset register (address 02h) which can be used to
                      implement several functions, such as:

                          • Accuracy tuning
                          • Aging adjustment
                          • Temperature compensation

                      [1]   Default value.

                      For MODE = 0, each LSB introduces an offset of 4.34 ppm. For MODE = 1, each LSB
                      introduces an offset of 4.069 ppm. The offset value is coded in two’s complement giving a
                      range of +63 LSB to 64 LSB.

                      [1]   Default value.

                      The correction is made by adding or subtracting clock correction pulses, thereby changing
                      the period of a single second but not by changing the oscillator frequency.

                      It is possible to monitor when correction pulses are applied. To enable correction interrupt
                      generation, bit CIE (register Control_1) has to be set logic 1. At every correction cycle, a
                      pulse is generated on pin INT. The pulse width depends on the correction mode. If
                      multiple correction pulses are applied, an interrupt pulse is generated for each correction
                      pulse applied.

              8.2.3.2   Correction when MODE = 1
                        The correction is triggered once every four minutes and then correction pulses are applied
                        once per second up to a maximum of 60 pulses. When correction values greater than 60
                        pulses are used, additional correction pulses are made in the 59th second.

                        Clock correction is made more frequently in MODE = 1; however, this can result in higher
                        power consumption.

                                         With the offset calibration an accuracy of 2 ppm (0.5  offset per LSB) can be reached (see
                                         Table 13).
                                         1 ppm corresponds to a time deviation of 0.0864 seconds per day.

              8.3.1.1   OS: Oscillator stop
                        When the oscillator of the PCF85063A is stopped, the OS flag is set. The oscillator can be
                        stopped, for example, by connecting one of the oscillator pins OSCI or OSCO to ground.
                        The oscillator is considered to be stopped during the time between power-on and stable
                        crystal resonance. This time can be in the range of 200 ms to 2 s depending on crystal
                        type, temperature, and supply voltage.

                        The flag remains set until cleared by command (see Figure 13). If the flag cannot be
                        cleared, then the oscillator is not running. This method can be used to monitor the
                        oscillator and to determine if the supply voltage has reduced to the point where oscillation
                        fails.

                         During read/write operations, the time counting circuits (memory locations 04h through
                         0Ah) are blocked.

                         The blocking prevents

                           • Faulty reading of the clock and calendar during a carry condition
                           • Incrementing the time registers during the read cycle
                         After this read/write access is completed, the time circuit is released again and any
                         pending request to increment the time counters that occurred during the read/write access
                         is serviced. A maximum of 1 request can be stored; therefore, all accesses must be
                         completed within 1 second (see Figure 15).

                           Fig 15. Access time for read/write operations

                         Because of this method, it is very important to make a read or write access in one go, that
                         is, setting or reading seconds through to years should be made in one single access.
                         Failing to comply with this method could result in the time becoming corrupted.

                         As an example, if the time (seconds through to hours) is set in one access and then in a
                         second access the date is set, it is possible that the time will increment between the two
                         accesses. A similar problem exists when reading. A roll-over may occur between reads
                         thus giving the minutes from one moment and the hours from the next.

                         Recommended method for reading the time:

                          1. Send a START condition and the slave address (see Table 39 on page 35) for write
                             (A2h)
                          2. Set the address pointer to 4 (Seconds) by sending 04h
                          3. Send a RESTART condition or STOP followed by START
                          4. Send the slave address for read (A3h)
                          5. Read Seconds
                          6. Read Minutes
                          7. Read Hours
                          8. Read Days
                          9. Read Weekdays
                         10. Read Months
                         11. Read Years
                         12. Send a STOP condition

                8.5.6 Alarm function
                      By clearing the alarm enable bit (AEN_x) of one or more of the alarm registers, the
                      corresponding alarm condition(s) are active. When an alarm occurs, AF is set logic 1. The
                      asserted AF can be used to generate an interrupt (INT). The AF is cleared by command.

                      The registers at addresses 0Bh through 0Fh contain alarm information. When one or
                      more of these registers is loaded with second, minute, hour, day or weekday, and its
                      corresponding AEN_x is logic 0, then that information is compared with the current
                      second, minute, hour, day, and weekday. When all enabled comparisons first match, the
                      alarm flag (AF in register Control_2) is set logic 1.

                      The generation of interrupts from the alarm function is controlled via bit AIE. If bit AIE is
                      enabled, the INT pin follows the condition of bit AF. AF remains set until cleared by
                      command. Once AF has been cleared, it will only be set again when the time increments
                      to match the alarm condition once more. Alarm registers which have their AEN_x bit at
                      logic 1 are ignored.

                      [2]   How the setting of TI_TP and the timer flag TF can affect the INT pulse generation is explained in
                            Section 8.2.2.3 on page 15.

                8.6.3 Timer functions
                      The timer has four selectable source clocks allowing for countdown periods in the range
                      from 244 s to 4 hours 15 min. For periods longer than 4 hours, the alarm function can be
                      used.

                      [1]   When not in use, TCF[1:0] must be set to 1⁄60 Hz for power saving.
                      [2]   Time periods can be affected by correction pulses.

                      Remark: Note that all timings which are generated from the 32.768 kHz oscillator are
                      based on the assumption that there is 0 ppm deviation. Deviation in oscillator frequency
                      results in deviation in timings. This is not applicable to interface timing.

                      The timer counts down from a software-loaded 8-bit binary value, T[7:0], in register
                      Timer_value. Loading the counter with 0 stops the timer. Values from 1 to 255 are valid.

                     When the counter decrements from 1, the timer flag (bit TF in register Control_2) is set
                     and the counter automatically re-loads and starts the next timer period.

                                 In this example, it is assumed that the timer flag is cleared before the next countdown period
                                 expires and that the pin INT is set to pulsed mode.
                      Fig 17. General countdown timer behavior

                     If a new value of T is written before the end of the current timer period, then this value
                     takes immediate effect. NXP does not recommend changing T without first disabling the
                     counter by setting bit TE logic 0. The update of T is asynchronous to the timer clock.
                     Therefore changing it without setting bit TE logic 0 may result in a corrupted value loaded
                     into the countdown counter. This results in an undetermined countdown period for the first
                     period. The countdown value T will, however, be correctly stored and correctly loaded on
                     subsequent timer periods.

                     When the TIE flag is set, an interrupt signal on INT is generated if this mode is enabled.
                     See Section 8.2.2 for details on how the interrupt can be controlled.

                     When starting the timer for the first time, the first period has an uncertainty. The
                     uncertainty is a result of the enable instruction being generated from the interface clock
                     which is asynchronous from the timer source clock. Subsequent timer periods do not have
                     such delay. The amount of delay for the first timer period depends on the chosen source
                     clock, see Table 37.

                        At the end of every countdown, the timer sets the countdown timer flag (bit TF in register
                        Control_2). Bit TF can only be cleared by command. The asserted bit TF can be used to
                        generate an interrupt at pin INT. The interrupt may be generated as a pulsed signal every
                        countdown period or as a permanently active signal which follows the condition of bit TF.
                        Bit TI_TP is used to control this mode selection and the interrupt output may be disabled
                        with bit TIE, see Table 35 and Figure 17.

                        When reading the timer, the current countdown value is returned and not the initial
                        value T. Since it is not possible to freeze the countdown timer counter during read back, it
                        is recommended to read the register twice and check for consistent results.

                        Timer source clock frequency selection of 1 Hz and 1⁄60 Hz is affected by the Offset
                        register. The duration of a program period varies according to when the offset is initiated.
                        For example, if a 100 s timer is set using the 1 Hz clock as source, then some 100 s
                        periods will contain correction pulses and therefore be longer or shorter depending on the
                        setting of the Offset register. See Section 8.2.3 to understand the operation of the Offset
                        register.

              8.6.3.1   Countdown timer interrupts
                        The pulse generator for the countdown timer interrupt uses an internal clock and is
                        dependent on the selected source clock for the countdown timer and on the countdown
                        value T. As a consequence, the width of the interrupt pulse varies (see Table 38).

9. Characteristics of the I2C-bus interface
                         The I2C-bus is for bidirectional, two-line communication between different ICs or modules.
                         The two lines are a Serial DAta line (SDA) and a Serial CLock line (SCL). Both lines must
                         be connected to a positive supply via a pull-up resistor. Data transfer may be initiated only
                         when the bus is not busy.

                     9.1 Bit transfer
                         One data bit is transferred during each clock pulse. The data on the SDA line must remain
                         stable during the HIGH period of the clock pulse, as changes in the data line at this time
                         are interpreted as a control signal (see Figure 18).

                         Both data and clock lines remain HIGH when the bus is not busy.

                         A HIGH-to-LOW transition of the data line while the clock is HIGH is defined as the START
                         condition - S.

                         A device generating a message is a transmitter; a device receiving a message is a
                         receiver. The device that controls the message is the master; and the devices which are
                         controlled by the master are the slaves (see Figure 20).

                     9.4 Acknowledge
                        The number of data bytes transferred between the START and STOP conditions from
                        transmitter to receiver is unlimited. Each byte of 8 bits is followed by an acknowledge
                        cycle.

                         • A slave receiver, which is addressed, must generate an acknowledge after the
                            reception of each byte
                         • Also a master receiver must generate an acknowledge after the reception of each
                            byte that has been clocked out of the slave transmitter
                         • The device that acknowledges must pull-down the SDA line during the acknowledge
                            clock pulse, so that the SDA line is stable LOW during the HIGH period of the
                            acknowledge related clock pulse (set-up and hold times must be considered)
                         • A master receiver must signal an end of data to the transmitter by not generating an
                            acknowledge on the last byte that has been clocked out of the slave. In this event, the
                            transmitter must leave the data line HIGH to enable the master to generate a STOP
                            condition

                         One I2C-bus slave address (1010001) is reserved for the PCF85063A. The entire I2C-bus
                         slave address byte is shown in Table 39.

                                       MSB                                                                                                                                  LSB
                                       1                 0                     1                   0                   0               0                 1                  R/W

                         After a START condition, the I2C slave address has to be sent to the PCF85063A device.

                         The R/W bit defines the direction of the following single or multiple byte data transfer
                         (R/W = 0 for writing, R/W = 1 for reading). For the format and the timing of the START
                         condition (S), the STOP condition (P) and the acknowledge bit (A) refer to the I2C-bus
                         characteristics (see Ref. 16 “UM10204”). In the write mode, a data transfer is terminated
                         by sending either the STOP condition or the START condition of the next data transfer.

                9.5.2 Clock and calendar READ or WRITE cycles
                         The I2C-bus configuration for the different PCF85063A READ and WRITE cycles is shown
                         in Figure 22 and Figure 23. The register address is a 5-bit value that defines which
                         register is to be accessed next. The upper 3 bits of the register address are not used.

[1]   For reliable oscillator start-up at power-on use VDD greater than 1.2 V. If powered up at 0.9 V the oscillator will start but it might be a bit
      slow, especially if at high temperature. Normally the power supply is not 0.9 V at start-up and only comes at the end of battery
      discharge. VDD min of 0.9 V is specified so that the customer can calculate how large a battery or capacitor they need for their
      application. VDD min of 1.2 V or greater is needed to ensure speedy oscillator start-up time.
[2]   400 kHz I2C operation is production tested at 1.8 V. Design methodology allows I2C operation at 1.8 V  5 % (1.71 V) which has been
      verified during product characterization on a limited number of devices.
[3]   Timer source clock = 1⁄60 Hz, level of pins SCL and SDA is VDD or VSS.
[4]   Tested on sample basis.
[5]   The I2C-bus interface of PCF85063A is 5 V tolerant.
[6]   Implicit by design.

[1]    A detailed description of the I2C-bus specification is given in Ref. 16 “UM10204”.
[2]    I2C-bus access time between two STARTs or between a START and a STOP condition to this device must be less than one second.
[3]    A device must internally provide a hold time of at least 300 ns for the SDA signal (with respect to the VIH(min) of the SCL signal) to bridge
       the undefined region of the falling edge of SCL.
[4]    The maximum tf for the SDA and SCL bus lines is specified at 300 ns. The maximum fall time for the SDA output stage tf is specified at
       250 ns. This allows series protection resistors to be connected in between the SDA and the SCL pins and the SDA/SCL bus lines
       without exceeding the maximum specified tf.

14. Application information
                     The data sheet values were obtained using a crystal with an ESR of 60 k. If a crystal with
                     an ESR of 70 k is used then the power consumption would increase by a few nA and the
                     start-up time will increase slightly.

                               A 1 farad super capacitor combined with a low VF diode can be used as a standby or back-up
                               supply. With the RTC in its minimum power configuration that is, timer off and CLKOUT off, the
                               RTC may operate for weeks.
                          (1) R1 limits the inrush current to the super capacitor at power-on.

                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.

                18.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.

                18.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:

                      • Through-hole components
                      • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.

                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.

                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:

                      • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                      • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                      • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                      • Package placement
                      • Inspection and repair
                      • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering

                18.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:

                      • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                      • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                18.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:

                      • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                         higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 35) than a SnPb process, thus
                         reducing the process window
                      • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                         window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                      • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                         heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                         temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                         characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                         packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                         depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                         Table 43 and 44

                     < 1.6                                   260                                         260                         260

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.

                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 35.
