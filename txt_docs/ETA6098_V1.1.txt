ETA6098

FUNTIONAL DESCRITION
ETA6098 is a switching Li-Ion battery charger capable of delivering up to 2.5A of charging current to the battery.
With OVP function, the IC can stand off input voltage as high as 32V, making it an ideal solution for industrial
applications. It features pre-charging, fast charging(CC) and constant voltage(CV) charging, end-of charging
termination, and auto-recharge. Charge current can be set by an external resistor connecting to ISET pin, and charge
status is output by STAT pin.
CC/CV Regulation Loop
There are CC/CV regulation loops built in ETA6098, with regulates either current or voltage as necessary to ensure
fast and safe charging of the battery. In a normal charge cycle, this loop regulates the current to the value set by the
external resistor at the ISET pin. Charging continues at this current until the battery cell voltage reaches the
termination voltage. At this point, the CV loop takes over, and charge current is allowed ti decrease as necessary to
maintain charging at the termination voltage.
Precondition Charge
A new charging cycle begins with the precondition state, and operation continues in this state until VBAT exceeds the
precondition threshold voltage. When operating in precondition state, the cell is charged at 200mA. Once VBAT
reaches the precondition threshold voltage, the state machine jumps to the fast charge state.
Fast Charge
If battery voltage is above preconditioning threshold, buck converter chargers battery with constant current. In fast
charge state, the ETA6098 charges at the current set by external resistor connected at ISET pin. For example, a 2A
fast charge current can be achieved by setting the resistor to be 82K. During a normal charge cycle, fast charge
continues in CC mode until VBAT reaches the charge termination voltage, at which point the ETA6098 enters into top
off state.
Top off
With the battery voltage approaches the end of charge (EOC) voltage (4.2V, preset internally), charge current
decreases as charging continues. In the top off state, the cell is charged in constant voltage (CV) mode. During a
normal charging cycle, charging proceeds until the charge current decreases below 130mA, the EOC threshold. And
then, the state machine terminates the charge cycle and jumps to the EOC state.
End of charge
When charge current decreases to 130mA, the buck converter ceases and keep monitoring the battery voltage.
Recharge
When battery voltage drops by 160mV below the EOC voltage, the Buck converter is turned on again, and re-start
the constant current charge cycle.

As given by above application circuit, one can real-time adjust the charge current by a PWM signal with different duty-
cycle. The Vpwm is the RC filtered voltage of the PWM signal, and it will change linearly with the duty-cycle of the PWM
signal. Followings are 2 examples of charge current’s relationship to VPWM. Please contact ETA engineers if one wants to
have specific real-time charge current setting, the choosing of R1 and Rset value will be provided quickly.
